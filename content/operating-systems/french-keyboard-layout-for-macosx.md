I don't know for you but I love my PC keyboard. When recently being forced to switch to Mac OSX, I had hard times dealing with a Mac OSX keyboard.

Tired of fighting my muscle-memory, I connected my PC usb keyboard but had to do some remapping for it to work properly.

For that I used [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele) which is a *free* Mac OS X software.

The result is [here](./static/French - PC.keylayout).

Enjoy.
